# Pilot plan review — Pub K Group

Open conflicts, gaps and risks in the planning docs. Resolved items are removed; the decisions themselves are in `docs/pilot-scope.md` → "Decided" and `docs/backlog.md` → "Needs human".
Last reviewed **Oct 23, 2026** against `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/pilot-scope.md`, `docs/architecture.md` (incl. "Read this first" items 1–10), `docs/architecture-v0.3-sponsor.pdf` and the pack in `.claude/`, `.github/`, `scripts/`.

## 1. Conflicts still open

1. **The sponsor PDF (v0.3, Oct 18) is behind everything else.** It still says:
   - Nichols Law fully in scope through Integris (M365 email, Teams, SharePoint) with its own Supabase project
   - Microsoft sign-in
   - All action modules switch on Dec 29, and a Dec 22 go-live
   - No GoHighLevel and no PKG-first pilot

   `architecture.md` and `pilot-scope.md` now disagree with all of these. Robert should get an updated PDF before signing.
2. **monday.com / Notion auth.** Pilot scope: API token and internal integration. Architecture §6 (not covered by "Read this first"): OAuth app / OAuth per workspace. The backlog follows the pilot scope; the connector contract keeps OAuth possible later.
3. **Email digest.** Architecture M11 lists an email digest; pilot scope and the backlog don't. Assumed out unless asked for.
4. **Downeaster (DE)** appears only in architecture §5.1 ("confirm whether in scope"). It isn't seeded.
5. **Basic notifications in Release A.** The pilot-scope Release A list doesn't name notifications; Release B has "notification polish". The backlog keeps basic web push (T-160/T-161) in A, because approvals on iPhone rely on a push. Say so if you want it moved.

## 2. Pack vs. backlog (handled in the backlog, listed for awareness)

- **Protected files:** `.claude/hooks/guard-files.sh` blocks agent edits to `.github/workflows/*` and `.env*`, and `settings.json` denies reading `.env.*` (including `.env.example`). T-004, T-025 and T-171 now deliver workflow changes as diffs in the PR body for you to apply. T-005 needs the env variable names from you (H-019).
- **Stop hook before the monorepo:** `.claude/hooks/check-on-stop.sh` runs `pnpm typecheck/lint/test` whenever `package.json` exists. Until T-001 is merged and pnpm is installed (H-018), it fails on every stop. It lets the second stop through (`stop_hook_active`), so work isn't blocked, but agents will report a failing check each time.
- **Toolchain:** this machine has Node v24.19.0, no pnpm and no Supabase CLI. CI and the pack assume Node 22 (H-018).
- **`ci.yml`** uses `pnpm/action-setup@v4` without a version, so T-001 must set `packageManager` in `package.json`.
- **`migrate-prod.yml`** runs the Supabase CLI from `supabase/core`. T-006 must use a folder layout that matches what the CLI expects there. There is no staging migration workflow yet (T-171 proposes one).
- **`agent-build.yml`** allows one agent at a time in CI. The parallel worktrees in the backlog are for local runs only.
- **`guard-bash.sh` matches substrings of the whole command line**, e.g. any command whose text contains `db push`, `curl ` or `PROD_`, even inside a heredoc or a docs edit. Expect occasional false positives; writing scripts to a file first avoids them.

## 3. Gaps

- **Metric definitions (D-9, D-3).** MRR/churn rules and the GoHighLevel paid-subscriber rule aren't written down. Both drive success criterion 1.
- **Entity mapping values (D-8).** The approach is decided (classes → customer mapping fallback, Stripe products, GHL tags/products, bank-account owners), but the actual IDs come from Sophie and are needed before tie-out.
- **AR/AP aging by class.** It isn't confirmed that the QuickBooks Reports API filters aging reports by class. T-052 should check this. If it can't, aging is computed from class-tagged invoices/bills in `fin.*` (T-083/T-084) and tied out to a class-filtered report Sophie runs in QBO.
- **Tie-out reference data.** The format of Sophie's manual weekly cash report isn't specified. T-094 assumes the reference figures are entered by hand.
- **TOTP recovery.** Magic link/email code gives AAL1 to whoever controls the mailbox, so TOTP is the real second factor and resets must not be self-service. Decide whether a reset needs the owner's approval; admin_technical alone shouldn't be able to reset Robert's factor.
- **Meeting notes source (D-12)** and **embedding provider (D-13)** are open but only block Release B.
- **iOS push** works only for an installed PWA on iOS 16.4+. Robert's iPhone needs checking.
- **Gmail restricted scopes:** an Internal-type OAuth app inside the pub-k.org Workspace avoids Google verification. That only applies if D-1 = Google.

## 4. Schedule risk

Release A is **115 tasks of up to a day each**, against about **22 working days** (Oct 26 – Nov 25). The pilot security test (T-170) gates approvals, so Release A needs to be feature-complete around **Nov 18–20**. Running tracks in parallel (backlog → "Parallel worktrees") raises throughput, but review stays the bottleneck: every PR needs your merge.

Ways to cut further, roughly by size:
1. **Decide D-1** and drop the other mail provider: removes 3 tasks from Release A (and 1 search task from Release B).
2. **Merge small tasks during the build.** Many platform tasks (e.g. T-014/T-015, T-016/T-017, T-030/T-034) are well under a day each with Claude Code. Re-forecast after T-001 – T-020.
3. **Allow a later PKG approvals go-live** (e.g. Nov 30, the start of Robert's test week) if T-170 slips. Success criterion 2 still holds without skipping the test.

**Tie-out window:** two consecutive weeks before Nov 25 means the live QuickBooks file must be in staging by about Nov 7–10 (H-017, which waits on Intuit approval). If Intuit is late, success criterion 1 slips past the pilot window.

## 5. Most urgent from you

1. **H-018** — install Node 22, pnpm and the Supabase CLI (blocks T-001 and the Stop hook).
2. **D-1** — the pub-k.org mail provider.
3. **D-8** — Sophie's mapping IDs, plus **D-2 / D-3 / D-9** metric definitions, before finance tie-out.
4. **H-019** — env variable names (blocks T-005).
5. **H-016** — Resend account + DNS; **D-15** — design sign-off (blocks T-024).
